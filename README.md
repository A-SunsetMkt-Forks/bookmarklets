# Usage
Copy and paste the source code (linked in the titles) prepended with `javascript:` into your bookmarks and open the bookmark to activate it.  
For example, the source code `function example() {};` should look like `javascript: function example() {};` when saving it as a bookmark.  
You may need something like [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/) if character limit is an issue.
